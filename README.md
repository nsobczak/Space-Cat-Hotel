Goal: attract as much tourists as possible down to earth.

- you are a space cat
- you run an interplanetary hotel company
- you must recruit space cat employees (worker)
- you must build building that can answer to extraterrestrial needs of clients
- when clients arrive you must move them to their room: assign a room and they move to it if it answers its needs and if it's empty, otherwise client keeps on waiting (and leaving if it's too long?)
